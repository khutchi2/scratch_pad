# Rust Notes
Installing Rust is pretty simply done using rustup: https://www.rust-lang.
Run the provided command in a terminal.  Stick with the standard install, and once it's done open a new terminal.  Type in the command `cargo` which is the Rust package manager to check it worked.

# Rust Projects
- `cargo new <project-name>
This creates a directory with some boilerplate for a Rust project.
It includes a "Hello World" file as well.
- `cargo run`
Compiles and runs the project.  `-q` flag can be added to forgo the debug information.
