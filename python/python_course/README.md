### OOP
#### Objects
- Objects are defined in pascal case
```python
timmy = turtle.Turtle()
```
with parentheses
- Classes are a blueprint for creating objects.
- Attributes are accessed using the pattern `object.attribute`
```python
car.speed
```
- Objects have functions associated with them, known as methods: `car.stop()`
